# This code person basic arithmetic operations of two numbers
number1 = 10  # defines value for first variable
number2 = 5   # defines value for second variable


# Performs the basic operations
sum = number1 + number2  
difference = number1 - number2 
product = number1 * number2  


# Outputs result of the basic operations
print("Addition of", number1, "and", number2, "is", sum) 
print("Difference of", number1, "and", number2, "is", difference) 
print("Product of", number1, "and", number2, "is", product)
