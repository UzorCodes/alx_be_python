# This code calculates the simple interest earned over a period of time
 
principle = 1000  # defines value for principle amount
rate = 0.05   # defines rate of interest per annum
time = 3  # defines the time period


# Calculate the simple interest
simple_interest = principle * rate * time 
 

# Outputs result of the calculation
print("The simple interest is:", simple_interest)
